# TiefightersProject

Problem: Darth Vader wants to check that his TIE fighter pilots are patrolling adequately-sized regions of the
galaxy. He has files of data that contain the patrol coordinates for each of his pilots. With the fear of being force
choked, you have agreed to write a program that analyzes the data and determines the size of the area patrolled
by the pilots.
